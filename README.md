# xworld2016

A repo for my workshop at X World 2016 "Bash For Beginners"

It contains a bunch of example scripts and the Markdown source and
reveal.js final for the presentation.

You may find that the HTML slides and the PDF files are behind the
actual source at any time. Sorry for that. The source file
`xworld2016-bash/md` is definitive.

The `slides.pdf` file is generated by running the slideshow in  a
browser with the query `?print-pdf` and then saving to PDF from the
print dialog. As the background doesn't print properly in the normal
slideshow the special version `print.html` has been created with the
command line `pandoc-print.sh` that doesn't include the background. So
to create the PDF the URL is
`http://localhost:8000/print.html?print-pdf` if you run `python -m
SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory. The `slides_notes.pdf` file is
generated using `Marked 2` and `Export as, Save PDF`.
