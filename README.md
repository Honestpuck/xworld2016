# xworld2016

A repo for my workshop at X World 2016 "Bash For Beginners"

It contains a bunch of example scripts and the Markdown source and
reveal.js final for the presentation.

You may find that the HTML slides and the PDF files are behind the
actual source at any time. Sorry for that. The source file
`xworld2016-bash/md` is definitive.
